Gefeliciteerd and congratulations to all ABBUC members! The Atari users of The Netherlands are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Atari and the 150th issue of ABBUC Magazine. Many Dutch user groups are already gone, but we wanted to show them one more time in this special little demo. Who are we? F#READY, SENIORROSSI, IVOP and FRED-M. We are Dutch members of ABBUC for many years and still proud owners of (several) Atari 8-bit computers. It is amazing that our Atari 8-bit club has survived for so many years and we hope that there are many more years to come. We want to say hello to the following people and groups: later in te vullen. We hope to see a lot of people at the next JHV in Herten, support the little Atari!
